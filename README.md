The Bank Loan Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize critical metrics related to loan performance, customer demographics, and financial trends. 
It allows financial institutions to monitor loan portfolios, assess customer profiles, and make informed decisions to optimize loan management strategies.
Key features include interactive visuals, loan performance metrics, and demographic analysis, all tailored to provide actionable insights.
Data for this dashboard comes from various anonymized financial records, including loan applications, customer profiles, and repayment histories. The dashboard reveals significant trends, such as high default rates among customers with credit scores below 600 and a growing number of loan approvals for customers aged 25-35. These insights can guide financial institutions in refining their loan approval processes and targeting specific customer segments.Built using Power BI, the dashboard incorporates DAX for custom calculations and Excel/SQL for data preparation. Users can download the Power BI file, explore the dashboard, and gain valuable insights into loan performance and customer behavior.
